# Lesson4 - Thread

## Overview

In this lesson, we will explore multithreading programming in an Embedded Linux environment. You will learn how to create, manage, and synchronize threads using the `pthread` library. This knowledge is crucial for system programming and optimizing application performance.

## Exercises

### **Exercise 1: Basic Thread Creation**

- **Description**: Write a program that creates two threads, each printing a message along with its thread ID.
- **Hint**: The program creates two threads, each printing a message along with its thread ID. The `pthread_join` function ensures that the main program waits for both threads to complete before exiting.

#### `pthread_create`

Used to create a new thread.

**Syntax:**

```c
int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine)(void *), void *arg);
```

**Parameters:**

- `thread`: Pointer to a `pthread_t` variable to store the thread ID.
- `attr`: Thread attributes (can be `NULL` for default settings).
- `start_routine`: The function to be executed by the thread.
- `arg`: Argument passed to the function (can be `NULL`).

#### `pthread_join`

Used to wait for a thread to complete.

**Syntax:**

```c
int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **retval);
```

When a thread finishes (either by returning from the function or calling `pthread_exit`), `pthread_join` ensures that the main program collects its result before proceeding.

#### When does a thread terminate?

- When the function inside the thread completes (`return`).
- When `pthread_exit()` is called.
- When the main program exits before calling `pthread_join` (which can cause issues if threads are still running).

### **Exercise 2: Thread Synchronization with Mutex**

- **Description**: Create three threads, each incrementing a `counter` variable 1,000,000 times.
- **Hint**: Use `pthread_mutex_lock/unlock` to ensure data safety.

```c
pthread_mutex_t lock;
int counter = 0;

void *increment(void *arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
        counter++;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
    }
    return NULL;
}
```

#### Why is a Mutex Needed in This Program?

In a multi-threaded program, when multiple threads access and modify a shared variable simultaneously, race conditions can occur. A race condition happens when multiple threads attempt to update a shared resource at the same time, leading to unpredictable results.

Using a mutex (mutual exclusion) ensures that only one thread at a time modifies the shared variable, preventing race conditions and ensuring data integrity.

#### What happens if we remove the mutex?

- Without a mutex, multiple threads might read the same value of `counter` and increment it simultaneously, leading to incorrect results.
- The final value of `counter` may be less than the expected value due to lost updates.

### **Exercise 3: Synchronizing Producer-Consumer**

- **Description**: Create a producer thread generating random numbers and a consumer thread reading those values.
- **Hint**: Use `pthread_cond_wait/signal` for thread synchronization.

### **Exercise 4: Counting Even and Odd Numbers**

- **Description**: Split a list of numbers into two parts, with one thread counting even numbers and another counting odd numbers.
- **Hint**: No mutex is needed since threads operate on separate data sets.

### **Exercise 5: Read-Write Lock**

- **Description**: Create 5 reader threads and 2 writer threads accessing a shared `data` variable.
- **Hint**: Use `pthread_rwlock_rdlock` to allow multiple readers concurrently.
