# Lesson4 - Thread

## Overview

In this lesson, we will explore multithreading programming in an Embedded Linux environment. You will learn how to create, manage, and synchronize threads using the `pthread` library. This knowledge is crucial for system programming and optimizing application performance.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Understand the concept of threads in Linux.
- Create and manage threads using `pthread`.
- Synchronize threads with mutexes, condition variables, and read-write locks.
- Handle resource contention issues in multithreading.

## Commands and Tools

| Command/Library                | Functionality                     |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `pthread_create`               | Create a new thread               |
| `pthread_join`                 | Wait for a thread to terminate    |
| `pthread_mutex_lock/unlock`    | Synchronize resource access       |
| `pthread_cond_wait/signal`     | Manage conditions between threads |
| `pthread_rwlock_rdlock/wrlock` | Manage read/write access control  |

## Exercises

### **Exercise 1: Basic Thread Creation**

- **Description**: Write a program that creates two threads, each printing a message along with its thread ID.
- **Hint**: Use `pthread_self()` to retrieve the current thread ID.

```c
void *print_message(void *arg) {
    printf("Thread ID: %lu\n", pthread_self());
    return NULL;
}
```

### **Exercise 2: Thread Synchronization with Mutex**

- **Description**: Create three threads, each incrementing a `counter` variable 1,000,000 times.
- **Hint**: Use `pthread_mutex_lock/unlock` to ensure data safety.

```c
pthread_mutex_t lock;
int counter = 0;

void *increment(void *arg) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&lock);
        counter++;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&lock);
    }
    return NULL;
}
```

### **Exercise 3: Synchronizing Producer-Consumer**

- **Description**: Create a producer thread generating random numbers and a consumer thread reading those values.
- **Hint**: Use `pthread_cond_wait/signal` for thread synchronization.

### **Exercise 4: Counting Even and Odd Numbers**

- **Description**: Split a list of numbers into two parts, with one thread counting even numbers and another counting odd numbers.
- **Hint**: No mutex is needed since threads operate on separate data sets.

### **Exercise 5: Read-Write Lock**

- **Description**: Create 5 reader threads and 2 writer threads accessing a shared `data` variable.
- **Hint**: Use `pthread_rwlock_rdlock` to allow multiple readers concurrently.
